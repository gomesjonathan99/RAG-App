So \\napart from macro data points, what are you seeing either in your \\nportfolio or client conversation or the pipeline that gives you more \\nconfidence around return of discretionary spend over a period of time? \\nK Krithivasan: See, there are a couple of things. One is there is a lot of optimization \\nwork going on. Some of the investments around technology debt have \\nnot taken place. For instance, there's a workaround technology \\nmodernization, mainframe modernization, that spending, and 1 good \\nthing is with the Generative AI becoming more and more mainstream,\"),\n",
